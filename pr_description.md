## Changes Made

### Grammar and Punctuation Corrections

### Clarity and Word Usage Improvements

- Changed 'regression' to 'regressions' (plural form)
- Fixed 'things that will be change' to 'things that will change'
- Removed duplicate word: 'what the actual expected output is'
- Changed 'counter intuitive' to 'counterintuitive' (one word)
- Changed 'maximise/minimise' to 'maximize/minimize' (American English spelling for consistency)

### Structural Improvements
- Fixed parallel structure in list: 'Waste' instead of 'Wasting' to match 'Spend'
- Removed unnecessary 'on' from 'Waste 5 hours chasing down'
- Added commas around parenthetical phrase: 'testing in personal projects, despite seeming somewhat counterintuitive,'

All changes maintain the original meaning and tone while improving readability and grammatical correctness.
