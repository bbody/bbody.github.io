## Summary

This PR contains proofreading corrections for the blog post '2022-12-20-setting-developers-up-for-failure.md' to improve English grammar and clarity.

## Changes Made

### Grammar and Clarity Improvements:

1. **Title correction** (Line 3): 
   - Changed 'Setting developer up for failure' to 'Setting developers up for failure' (fixed plural form)

2. **Subject-verb agreement** (Line 9):
   - Fixed 'all IT staff we would spend' to 'all IT staff would spend' (removed redundant 'we')

3. **Conjunction redundancy** (Line 19):
   - Changed 'While computers with high end specifications may not be cheap, but they are' to 'While computers with high-end specifications may not be cheap, they are' (removed redundant 'but' after 'While', also hyphenated 'high-end')

4. **Article usage** (Line 21):
   - Changed 'calculations of an USA developer' to 'calculations for a US developer' (corrected article 'an' to 'a' and preposition 'of' to 'for', simplified 'USA' to 'US')

5. **Possessive and verb agreement** (Line 40):
   - Fixed 'where a developers time therefore an organization's money can saved' to 'where a developer's time and therefore an organization's money can be saved' (added possessive apostrophe, inserted 'and' for clarity, added missing 'be')

6. **Missing comparative structure** (Line 42):
   - Changed 'make a developers work experience frictionless as possible' to 'make a developer's work experience as frictionless as possible' (fixed possessive, added missing 'as' in the 'as...as' construction)

All changes preserve the original meaning and intent of the blog post while improving readability and grammatical correctness.
