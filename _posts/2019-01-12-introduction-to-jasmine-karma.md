At work I did a presentation on how to unit test JavaScript with Jasmine and Karma which was well received. So I thought I would redo the presentation for Youtube as per my previous [TDD video](https://brendonbody.blog/2018/07/07/test-driven-development/).

It also is accomanied by [lecture notes](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/B9igWPo9aEP4e) and [code repository](https://github.com/bbody/jasminekarmaexample).
