I am a simple man, I want to keep things simple, I want to clone a project from GitHub and it to Just Workâ„¢. Over time, my projects have ended up using different languages and different versions.

This was fine when I was just using Ruby for a single project but as I used multiple versions of Ruby, I needed [rvm](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Adding in frontends, I needed to manage Node versions, so I installed [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Then I started to need different DB versions. It was a mess... When I was consulting, it wasn't uncommon for me to work on multiple projects in a year with different Ruby, Node, PostGres, Redis, MySQL, ElasticSearch, etc. within a single year. Once someone stumbled across [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/), nearly everyone including myself adopted it pretty quickly.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/g) could help get around this, but using an Apple Silicon MacOS means they run pretty slow, if the container can run at all. So I now mostly use ASDF to manage my project's versions. It is open source with a large developer community behind it. It allows me to use just one set of commands to manage the versions of languages and tools I need with.

Officially supports (As of January 2023):
- Ruby
- Erlang
- Elixir
- NodeJS

ASDF also provides a way to [develop plugins](https://asdf-vm.com/plugins/create.html) to add your own languages and binaries.

Some [3rd party plugins](https://github.com/asdf-community/) that I have used are:
- Redis
- MySQL
- Postgres
- ElasticSearch
- Rust
- Go
- Poetry

It has been great for working on my projects. I can quickly switch between projects and not need to think about changing my tool versions. Coupled with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), it keeps everything very simple.

In one of my more complex projects, the ASDF config (*.tool-versions*) looks like:

```
python 3.10.2
poetry 1.3.2
redis 6.2.5
postgres 14.0
```

I `cd` into that directory and those binaries with the correct version are already ready for me to develop. It works across multiple operating systems, sometimes I develop on my Mac and sometimes on my Ubuntu box. I can even use it in my Docker images to set up multiple languages.

That being said, on some of my projects a development environment as close as possible to staging/production is required. In that case the speed penalty of using Docker might be worth the cost. If you don't have many projects and/or the version numbers aren't important, using your system or the language specific version manager might be a better choice. Although there are a lot of plugins for ASDF, there are some languages that aren't supported.

All-in-all, I am fully sold on ASDF. It is great for local development, particularly when the requirements can be managed with a package manage. Once you have it installed, you might as well use it for all projects.
