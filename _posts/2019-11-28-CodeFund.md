Recently I launched [Fit on a Floppy](https://www.brendonbody.com/2019/11/13/fit-on-a-floppy/), a tool for determining if a website can fit on a floppy disk (1.44MB). Despite creating a few website tools before, I never really thought about monetization. The pure fact that it scratched my own itch and potentially could be useful to other people was enough for me. However Fit on a Floppy was different, I [bought a domain](https://www.brendonbody.com/2019/11/11/3am-domains/) for it [fitonafloppy.website](https://fitonafloppy.website/), I had AWS Hosting. This was different to my other projects where my only cost was time.

So I thought about avenues for recouping some of my costs, ideally Without adding more value I didn't see much point in creating premium features for Fit on a Floppy. [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) didn't seem like a right fit as my project doesn't add a large benefit to the open source community. The idea of adding ads didn't really occur to me as I've had average results with Google Adsense in the past. After reading a discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21397274) about Google Ad alternatives, I found about [CodeFund](https://codefund.io/).

CodeFund is aimed at developers and open source projects, it itself is even open source. Looking at the example add, I was impressed by how clean it and unobtrusive it was.

A few of the things that jump out to me:
- Ethical ads
- Quick approval
- Great support
- Allows fallback ads
- Easy to use
- Unobtrusive ads
- Decent payouts

This of course as at the time of writing and these advantages don't necessarily apply at time reading.

I have made enough ad revenue to cover the financial costs I incurred on Fit on a Floppy, so I am satisfied and anything above that is icing on the cake. I have since added ads onto a few of my other projects but they don't receive the same type of attention. So far I am happy with CodeFund but I might give [Carbon Ads](https://www.carbonads.net/) a try for future projects where it makes sense.

This is not a paid review nor do I have any relationship with Codefund.
