# Remove

So I am back to blogging on [www.BrendonBody.com](http://www.brendonbody.com/ "Dormeo Ergo Sum") after a 3 month long hiatus. 

So instead of just rebooting, I decided to rethink how I approach my blog. I documented this process on [Medium](https://medium.com/) here:

- [Blog Rethink Part 1: I've made a huge mistake or how I deleted my blog](https://medium.com/@brendonbody/blog-rethink-part-1-Medium here:i-ve-made-a-huge-mistake-or-how-i-deleted-my-blog-fe6d56fa6e1e "Blog Rethink Part 1")
- [Blog Rethink Part 2: What the blog am I doing?](https://medium.com/@brendonbody/blog-rethink-part-2-5086b15c6478 "Blog Rethink Part 2")
