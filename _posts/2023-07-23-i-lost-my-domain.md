Last year, during a particularly hectic period, I neglected my email inbox and, regrettably, overlooked several warnings from my Domain Registrar regarding the impending expiration of my domain, *brendonbody.com*. This domain has been mine for over 10 years, and while it had expired once before, I was always able to buy it back. This time, however, a [domain squatter](https://www.godaddy.com/resources/skills/what-is-domain-squatting-and-what-can-you-do-about-it) seized the opportunity and snapped it up.

Faced with a minimum bid of $500 USD to reclaim my domain, I seriously contemplated whether maintaining a blog was worth it.

Despite the considerable gaps between my posts, and despite [accidentally deleting my previous blog]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/02/21/hello-world-again/), I realized that I genuinely enjoy the process of blogging. I write for my own personal satisfaction, not for self-marketing purposes, and I've even stopped paying attention to my analytics. So the loss of incoming links and search engine ranking didn't bother me. I don't have any plan to write X posts over Y time period, I will just continue blogging when I feel like I want to say something.

I concluded that I wanted to continue blogging, but I wasn't willing to pay to reclaim my old domain. So, I opted for a new domain, [brendonbody.blog](https://brendonbody.blog/). I promptly updated the references on all platforms within my control, and decided to make peace with the remaining broken links. It was a mistake on my part, and these were simply the consequences I had to accept. So I lost my domain and I don't care...
