A few months ago, I finished the [Advanced Cybersecurity Program at Stanford University online](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/advanced-cybersecurity-program), and I thought I would share my thoughts on it.

For a while, I had been meaning to learn the basics of cybersecurity from a developer's perspective. When looking at courses, many were either very risk-focused or highly technical in the sense of writing exploits. I wanted to find something broader that focused on the development aspect. The Stanford course ticked that box for me.

Let's address the elephant in the room first: it is expensive—$3,250 USD. I was lucky enough to have my company pay half of this course for me, and the rest is tax-deductible in Australia. If my company hadn't covered half of the cost, I wouldn't have taken the course. So, I would not recommend this course unless it is being funded, as there are many great, cheaper resources that will also provide you with a certificate. Now that that's out of the way, onto the course itself...

The course is self-paced and allows you to complete it within a year from registration. You are required to complete 5 out of 6 elective courses; I completed all of them.

[**Foundations of Information Security:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs101-foundations-information-security) A decent introduction to the different parts of the course.

[**Using Cryptography Correctly:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs130-using-cryptography-correctly) Very math-heavy, but I learned quite a bit about cryptography. I didn't expect to enjoy this one, but I did.

[**Writing Secure Code:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs131-writing-secure-code) This was mostly revision, but I did learn about some program analysis tools. This was the type of course I was most anticipating, and it proved quite useful as a developer.

[**Exploiting and Protecting Web Applications:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs133-exploiting-and-protecting-web-applications) Although the assignments were very outdated, the practical aspect of writing exploits and then fixing them was great. Probably my favorite course in the program.

[**Mobile Security:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs215-mobile-security) I didn't know much about mobile security going into this course, but I ended up learning a lot about the fundamentals.

[**Network Security:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs255-network-security) The refresher on how the internet and networks work was useful, though I had covered it before. Much of the security-specific content was new to me; I'm not sure if I'll ever use it, but I'm glad I got my feet wet.

[**Cybersecurity and Executive Strategy:**](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs302-cybersecurity-and-executive-strategy) As I mentioned before, I only needed to complete 5 elective courses to earn the certificate, and this was the one I originally didn't plan to do. I didn't expect to like this course, but I ended up learning a lot about cybersecurity from an executive perspective.

One of the highlights of the course was the guest interviews with industry leaders. They were a nice addition, but not necessarily a significant selling point.

One downside that stood out was the LMS (Learning Management System), which feels quite outdated but did the job.

Overall, I got a lot out of the course, and most importantly, I got what I wanted from it. After completing the course, I’ve noticed a few changes in my approach:

- When coding or conducting reviews, I am more cognizant of security implications.
- Architecture-wise, I now think more about egress/ingress points and their security implications.
- I have a better understanding of security during conversations.
- I can better understand and appreciate existing security decisions.

**TL;DR:** To reiterate, I probably would not have done this course if my company hadn't paid half, and I definitely would not have done it if it weren't tax-deductible as an education expense.
