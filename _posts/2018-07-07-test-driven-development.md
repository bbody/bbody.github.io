A few years ago I bought a [microphone](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/meteormic) and in the excitement of testing it out I decided to make a video. At the time I was very interested in TDD (Test Driven Development), making the video was an interesting experience and also helped me understand TDD.

If you are intested in TDD, I hope the below video is able to give you a good introduction on the topic.
