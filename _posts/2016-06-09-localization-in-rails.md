Regardless of whether you are planning to build a multi-language site or not (this will be covered in a future post), externalizing strings is a good programming practice. You can think of it as another way of abstracting different layers of your code further apart.

**Typical Ruby on Rails Application Structure:**

- **HTML:** content and basic structure
- **CSS:** look and feel
- **JavaScript:** web browser logic
- **Ruby on Rails:** generates HTML based on the data and state

**Ruby on Rails Application Structure with localization:**

- **HTML:** content placeholder and basic structure
- **Localization:** content
- **CSS:** look and feel
- **JavaScript:** web browser logic
- **Ruby on Rails:** generates HTML based on the data and state

This pattern not only allows us to keep our copy separate from our code, but also allows us to reuse common terms (e.g., page titles, special terms, etc.) that can all be changed from one central location. Another use case is for generic termsâ€”for example, if you want the alt text for a close button to be "Close" instead of "Exit". This is normally not a problem until you forget your naming convention or another developer joins the team. By externalizing strings, this becomes less of a problem. Additionally, if you ever need to change a term, it's a matter of editing it once rather than using find to track down every usage. Rewriting a function in multiple places is a violation of the DRY principle, so we shouldn't do it to our text either.

Luckily for us, Ruby on Rails provides a built-in and easy way to externalize strings. 

## Add externalized variables
Simply by going to `app_name/config/locales/en.yml`, you will find a "Hello World" example. At the moment it looks quite bare, but we will add some more content.

However, first it is useful to go through a few different ways to store information in the locale file:

- **Simple string:** A typical way of storing a small bit of information
- **Placeholder variables:** *#{}* Allows input variables to replace placeholders, similar to template files
- **Multiline strings:** The *>* symbol allows for multiline strings in *YAML*

You can see these three types in the below example.

Another useful feature of the locale file is the ability to use keys to specify different levels. This allows us to more neatly organize strings by their page, element, topic, etc. In the example below, you can see *page1* and *page2* organizing the file.
	
### Example
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bbody/459c55670ec239c62175ee669d15069f.js?file=en.yaml"></script>

## Calling it from Controller/Template
There are multiple methods of calling the translation from controller or template code. Personally, I use the more verbose call because most, if not all, strings in my projects are usually externalized, so I expect `t` to be used often.

### Example
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bbody/459c55670ec239c62175ee669d15069f.js?file=translation_methods.rb"></script>

## Calling it from Template
The controller methods can be used in the templates, however, the notable addition is that you can add `t` to the start of an inline tag to denote that it is an externalized string, which you can see below. I find this a very efficient way to represent inline content in a template.

### Example
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bbody/459c55670ec239c62175ee669d15069f.js?file=translation_methods.html.erb"></script>

## Conclusion 

This has been a very brief guide covering the basics of string externalization in Ruby on Rails. However, you can also refer to the [official guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html), which has a much more in-depth explanation and reference.
