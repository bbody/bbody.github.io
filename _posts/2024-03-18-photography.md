For those of you who've read my blog or know me in person, you would probably not be surprised that even outside of my 9-5, I am found not far from my computer.
Most of my hobbies involve being at a computer, which, after years, had finally taken a toll on my relaxation.

In 2023, after some travel, I decided I needed some time away from my computer.
Thinking of a new hobby that would get me away from the computer was overwhelming, so I looked to my past to find a hobby I would enjoy.
In the past, I really enjoyed photography, and it meets my requirement of being away from the computer.

The above was taken in 2016 with my old [Nikon D3100](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product-archive/dslr-cameras/d3100.html). Unfortunately, I sold my old DSLR and Point and Shoot Digicam years ago when I lost interest in photography.
My first port of call was to use my phone, however I found:

- Using it can be distracting due to other apps
- In one way I'd be trading one computer for another (And yes... I know digital cameras essentially have computers in them)
- Messing with the exposure triangle can be frustrating in camera apps that allow you to
- I missed the ergonomics and control right at your fingers

An independent camera seemed like the solution to my problem.
So initially I tried to buy the same model as my old cameras again however, I found they were more expensive than what I had sold them for.
Then illogically, I jumped straight to buying a new camera, flirting with the idea of a Sony for a while but eventually ending up getting a Fujifilm mirrorless camera.

After a few in-person classes and a lot of practice, I have really found a love for photography.
I even dipped my toes into [film photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/93902604@N05/collections/72157722673733820/) and using an older [Point and Shoot Digicam](https://www.flickr.com/photos/93902604@N05/collections/72157722635086099/) to get a 2000s effect.
But for the most part, I've stuck to Straight out of Camera (SooC) on my Fujifilm mirrorless camera.
Without sounding too clich√©, it has become an extension of myself, and when I think of framing a photo, I often default to a 50mm full-body equivalent frame.
Looking at photos and movies now, I have learnt a new respect for their framing and composition.

This new hobby has succeeded in getting me away from the computer and walking more.
It has made me appreciate the beauty around me a lot more, often seeing things as scenes and being more aware of the things around me.
For someone who isn't very creatively inclined, it has been a good way to express and grow that aspect of myself.
It has also opened up some new things to talk about with my friends who also enjoy photography.

However, it hasn't only been positives. I have found myself being pulled back to the computer.
I've spent a lot of time sorting images, so I obviously scratched my own itch.
I developed a desktop application to help me sort photos quickly (post to come soon!).

Despite normally shooting in mostly manual mode and uploading SooC images, I sometimes feel that editing might help.
And when I say editing, I mean beyond cropping and changing exposure.
There is a lot to learn, and I am not sure I am ready for that commitment yet.

Another problem, like many new photographers, is that I got GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome).
Although I have mostly recovered, it was an expensive expedition.

All-in-all, this new hobby has been very rewarding.
It has provided me a whole new avenue of escape from my computer.
I've experienced a lack of enthusiasm from time to time and even burnout, but the journey has taught me much about patience, creativity, and the importance of stepping away from the familiar.
Looking ahead, I'm excited to explore new photography techniques and develop my own.
I encourage everyone to find that one activity that offers a break usual and invites new perspectives.

What's your escape?
